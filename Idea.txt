Reverse the roles

you control alot of enemys that has to kill (or smth) the "player" that is usualy played

Binding of isac like game, where an algorithm plays the player but you control the room






Flappy bird, but you control the rods (Rods alot smaller (bigger holes) and you can only change them so far) (Bird Flappy / Flappy Tubes)
The Algorithm controls the bird, but the player has to adjust the rods, that the bird does NOT crash. Get as far as possible

Player has Resouce that he can use to decrease the size of a rod. He earns the resource over time, or by making another rod larger

The Game speeds up over time

Events that make the bird go up / down / faster / slower / .... room for more ideas
Powerups that can be collected by the Player (Powerup Power: Remove Tube, Slow game down, 





Possible Fixes later on:
insivible trigger collider under bird, that makes it jump.

When generating Tubes first Instanciate the first one with random numbers and instantiate the second one based on the first ones random values.
(So the gap is always decent enough)

ToDo: Smooth the tube positioning

Music and Audio Mute buttons

Make Highscore
Make an event where the tubes move up and down without the player doing anything. (Maybe increase the tube gap during that event)
